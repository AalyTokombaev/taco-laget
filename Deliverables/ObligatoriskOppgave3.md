# Deloppgave 1:

## Does the roles in the team work?
* The roles work good, and all ambiguity that arised in the beginnning of the project is cleared up. Everyone is confident with their role in the project.
* Teamlead takes responsibility for the meetings and meeting minutes and for clearing up whatever is unclear at the time. Makes sure all the user stories applies and is put down on "paper"
* QA is taking resonsibility for everything needed ot be tested and makes sure tests that do are not optimal or not in use are removed before the final commit.
* Senior and Junior developers comes up with a lot of good code and solutions for the most optimal solutions. They cooperate a lot with rulekeeper, shich also contributes with a lot of good solutions to problems.
* Rulekeeper has everything under control regarding rules and makes sure the game is developed correctly according to the rules of the traditional board game, Roborally.

## Are there experiences worth mentioning reagarding the team or the teams method?
* The team works good and we collaborate very well. We meet and talk several times a week and you can see that we have progress in the project.
* Physical meetings work a lot better, faster is more effective. We still keep most meetings digital because the team has more time to meet then.
* It works good for the team to focus on one problem at a time considering that most of the meetings and lectures are digital, so we do not need to wonder what is going on since we do not yet trust the project board 100%.
* Playing multiplayer from several computers has taken a lot more time and is a lot more challenging than expected.
* We have now learned from about MVP and what it means and takes to satisfy and MVP. We have learned that time-demanding tasks should be started pretty early in the process. We chose to delay the most demanding task till the end, since we wanted 
  as most as possibly done early. For next time we know to start earlier on critical/demanding tasks. Despite pushing it, it has worked out fine.

## Does the team agree on the choices taken, and if not what could be improved?
* We have had a good dialog thoughout the project, and the choices have been discussed with everyone that wished to take part.
* We have met several times a week to discuss potential problems and progress.  
* Whenever there has been a big issue, it has been dicussed in the meetings with everyone to find a solution as quickly as possible.  
* We all agree on the choices we have done throughout.
* If there is something we would change it is starting earlier on the multiplayer part of the MVPs since it was a bigger task than first expected.  
* There has been a few cases where the tasks have been done in the last minute, which could have been avoided with a bit more planning.
* For the third sprint we should have everything ready at least a day before the deadline, so no one needs to work at night or right before the deadline to finish tasks.

## Retrospektiv
* __What have we managed to do until now?__
  * We have learned more about each others ways of working and routines, which make sit easier to know what to expect, and when to expect it.  
  * __MVPs__
    * We have finished all MVPs besides Multiplayer which was more work than first expected.
    * We have a working game which can be played single player at the moment.
    * We have implemented a main menu which needs to be improved
  * __What can be improved?__
    * The main menu
    * We wish to add sound effects to the game, and potentially music
    * We wish to have a built-in chat in the game as a simple way to communicate though the game.  
    * We will work on these things throughout the sprint 3, and hope to finish some of it until the deadline for mandatory assignment 3.
  * __How does the communication and cooperation work?__
    * The cooperation works good
    * Communication works good. 
    * We can still get better at moving things around in Projectboard, but things are going well because we work on a lot together, and therefore know exactly what is being done at the moment.
  

## Maximum three points of improvement from the retrospective
* Creating issues for every little task.
* Create a more detailed plan for mandatory assignment 4, so nothing will be done in the last minute

## Hvordan har vi prioritert oppgavene fremover?
1. Finish the multiplayer
2. Main menu
3. Grid
4. Chat
5. Sound


## Hvordan fungerer gruppedynamikken og kommunikasjonen?

## Demands
* Oppdater krav, hvor langt vi har kommet, prioriterte krav og hva vi har gjort siden sist?
  * Krav
  1. Multiplayer
  2. Main menu
  3. Grid



## Mvp-krav:
* __Changes in MVPs__
* We have focused on MVP 5: Multiplayer last of the mandatory demands.  
  * The reason for this is that the other tasks looked easier and more quickly to get out of the way. 
  * We had not taught ourselves enough about how to prioritize MVP-demands before-hand. If we knew what we know now about 
    how to prioritize MVPs, we probably would have started the Multiplayer-demand earlier.
  * Even though we did start in the wrong direction, everything is going well now, and we are happy about our progress. We have even get to started on our own MVPs, 
    and are hoping to be done with Multiplayer soon enough.
  
* __What MVP do we find most important and why?__
* The most important MVP-demand for us is to show a game-board and to be able to move the game-piece so you can do something in the game
* Without a board or a game-piece there is not possible to anything in the game resembling to playing.

## Hva vil vi ha med ekstra:
* Chat
* Lyd

## Bugs i kravene

## Testing: Manuelle og automatiske
* Anders lager

## Ulikhet i commits
* Since we have different areas of the project we are responsible for, there is a difference in commits. 
  * Tore and Alex have a lot more commits than the rest as they are responsible for committing the best solutions for everything.
